best practices for open design

I watched a discussion from [TABConf 22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5taAFJR-jA) and one meaningful thing I took from this was practices for contributing to open design that developers find easier to work with. These concepts I will need to become familiar with: _flexbox_ and _designing modular components_.

ALSO: _storybook_.

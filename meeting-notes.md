This week I attended [ABDC](https://abdc.dev). These things were discussed:
- River lightning dashboard, what is its 'why'? Reminded me that creating a dashboard is a good example project, and interestingly in the strict on individual freedom and privacy world, dashboards can be especially challenging. What information to present, what information is shared over software, how to abstract difficult concepts in order to get useful information at-a-glance, etc.
- a blog post sharing a company's struggle with growth, understanding their 'why', their user, what problem they solve, being transparent about how it has changed over the course of the company's life. That's always good to see, transparency.
- someone said something to the effect of 'mempool.space has staying power because it feels alive.' When you show up at that site, you see things are happening, time is real there. I have tried and failed to capture this in a poem once. But it's good to remember what draws us to something at the core, very deep within, is life, the presence of it, the activity.
- [Config](https://config.figma.com) happened recently, so there are things to learn there, talks to watch. I plan on seeing some of them. New updates to Figma seem to be big for developer interoperability.
- I asked a question about best outcomes for working on a project in the open with the design community. Here's what I learned - consistency is what makes a stand-out contributor in this open-source environment.

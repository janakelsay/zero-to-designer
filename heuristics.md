[time-tested design heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics)

- we're talking about more than principles, more than guidelines, we're talking about the rails that carry the load of design to success.
- I am studying this in preparation for the Geyser research project. I have been pointed in a solidly thought-out direction so that I can capture value for them in the research I conduct. So to jog these research muscles, I am going gather some initial notes on how Geyser.fund meets these heuristics, alongside the competitive analysis notes I am making about GoFundMe. I am recording these notes [here](https://www.figma.com/file/lZuZA65LRqi1B3uRWMH6sE/UX-Research-for-Geyser?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=qyWrGiA63Gn0dzUi-1).

[Figma setup for UI/UX design projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HKfkMlT4X0)
- from Aliena Cai on youtube, I understood an organizing system for pages within a Figma project. She includes these pages: Thumbnail, Documentation, Information Architecture, Personas/User Journey, Prototype Final, Working Prototype, and Archive Prototype.
- I created thumbnails for my existing projects.

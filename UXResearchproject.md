Today is an exciting day, things are happening. At [bitcoinerjobs.com](https://bitcoinerjobs.com/job/980032-user-research-intern-geyser) I found an internship I'm really interested in. Because I'm so new to this, I'm building my confidence by doing exercises in user studies on myself as the user this week. The internship is for Geyser, which I have used before to find and contribute to projects in bitcoin that I like.
- The first few things I did today were not helpful. I wasted some time on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAARmsv1tms). It didn't have anything new to tell me, that's all. Well done, though. Wonderfully lit setting for the video.
- Next I was setting up a thumbnail for the project I'm starting, and that led me to discover how to insert and adjust an image. I got stuck on transparency for a while, but then found this:

[thankful](https://www.websitebuilderinsider.com/how-do-i-make-an-image-transparent-on-figma/)

- I sought out some advice on beginner UX projects, and thanks to [4 Unique UX research projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w6mveOZp9Q) I got an idea of what I can focus on.
- I'm also looking at [UX Portfolio: How to create a UX design case study](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK8ApUzfjsk) from a creator I found last week on Youtube who has got some quality info.

- So for the rest of the week, I'm going to work on collecting a useful file set that means something valuable to the people at Geyser, learning it all from zero on the internet.

- It is day 2 on the project. Learned a lot. Thanks to [Figma Community](https://www.figma.com/community) I have a plugin for emojis, which begins to satisfy my curiousity about the usefulness of plugins. I was also able to get a couple templates to guide my project. 
- Getting comfortable with Figma, making sense of layout, layers, pages, colors, duplicating, like all kinds of stuff, tbh.
- I'm realizing I may need to make some changes on my portfolio site in order to include this project in a meaningful way when I present it in my application. Don't know what those changes are yet.
- Here is a screenshot from an idea I was having about the presentation of my understanding of the product's user's journey. I don't like it, and don't think it works.

Here we are on the third day, hello. Boy, I am enjoying this, really. I am getting comfy with Figma thanks to this project.

- After today I got clearer on what I can present that's valuable with minimal data. I added in screenshots from the site and my notes on the experience of using it. I know what I need to finish it, and I like that it looks clean and simple. I think that's the whole goal of Figma.
- With all that I'm learning, I'm excited to get back to Space Explorer next week to try out some new things, and fill in gaps on that idea.

It is day five. I made no report on day four! Yikes!
- The research project for Geyser has reached its MVP, and wouldn't you know it, Figma allows shareable links. That is it's advantage over other design tools. [So here it is.](https://www.figma.com/file/lZuZA65LRqi1B3uRWMH6sE/UX-Research-for-Geyser?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=T3E4clZwDB2dVmLj-1)
- I really like how my vision became realized. I got to juice it up with my own flavor of creativity and flare, and I learned a heck of a lot.

It is a new day. I am onto a new-ish project. I browsed [Bitcoin UX Research Tooklkit](https://bitcoinresearch.xyz) to learn more about research, and I'm very happy this resource exists to save me time from slogging through a bunch of copy on UX research that does not pertain to building on bitcoin. I shared feedback on this site via chat on discord, comment on repo, and a Google Form. 

This week, I am going to see what happens when I attempt a competitive analysis. Building off of where I was going with research focused on Geyser, I am going to compare their user experience to the obvious competitor: GoFundMe. I am sure they have done this to some extent. I do not know if I will dredge up anything useful, but if anything, it's more experience with Figma formatting, research methods, and interpreting insights.

- here's the starting point for this analysis

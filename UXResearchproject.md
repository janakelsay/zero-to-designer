Today is an exciting day, things are happening. At [bitcoinerjobs.com](https://bitcoinerjobs.com/job/980032-user-research-intern-geyser) I found an internship I'm really interested in. Because I'm so new to this, I'm building my confidence by doing exercises in user studies on myself as the user this week. The internship is for Geyser, which I have used before to find and contribute to projects in bitcoin that I like.
- The first few things I did today were not helpful. I wasted some time on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAARmsv1tms). It didn't have anything new to tell me, that's all. Well done, though. Wonderfully lit setting for the video.
- Next I was setting up a thumbnail for the project I'm starting, and that led me to discover how to insert and adjust an image. I got stuck on transparency for a while, but then found this:
<img width="813" alt="transparency" src="https://github.com/janakelsay/zero-to-designer/assets/96694416/181e46c9-9f36-4af4-8c68-66f9d52e79e6">

[thankful](https://www.websitebuilderinsider.com/how-do-i-make-an-image-transparent-on-figma/)

- I sought out some advice on beginner UX projects, and thanks to [4 Unique UX research projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w6mveOZp9Q) I got an idea of what I can focus on.
- I'm also looking at [UX Portfolio: How to create a UX design case study](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK8ApUzfjsk) from a creator I found last week on Youtube who has got some quality info.

- So for the rest of the week, I'm going to work on collecting a useful file set that means something valuable to the people at Geyser, learning it all from zero on the internet.

[How to start a new UI project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOQJO_V7sew)
- Objective: Explore fonts to find a title and byline that conveys trustworthiness _and_ geekiness
- 1. where will I go to explore fonts? What I know right now is [Canva](https://www.canva.com). I know it and it's free, so that will work for now. I have a file there that I've already been using for misc. design stuff called "for fun."

- 2. I spent maybe 20 minutes on this. Because I was using Space Explorer, my example project, as the subject, I inverted colors black and white, and I hope that isn't cheating. The first is default, no change. The next three are my attempts at finding a way to say Space Explorer that makes you feel it is trustworthy and also geeky.
